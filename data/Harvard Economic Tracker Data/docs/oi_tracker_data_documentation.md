<p>Please note that both the data and this data documentation is updated regularly and that the following information is subject to change.</p>
<h1 id="data-series">Data Series</h1>
<h2 id="consumer-spending">Consumer Spending</h2>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized purchase data from consumer credit and debit card spending. Spending is reported based on the ZIP code where the cardholder lives, not the ZIP code where transactions occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.affinity.solutions/dataforgood">Affinity Solutions</a></p>
<p><strong>Update Frequency:</strong> Weekly</p>
<p><strong>Date Range:</strong> January 13th until the most recent date available.</p>
<p><strong>Data Frequency:</strong> Data is daily until the final two weeks of the series, and the daily data is presented as a 7 day lookback moving average. For the final two weeks of the series, the data is weekly and presented as weekly data points.</p>
<p><strong>Index Period:</strong> January 4th - January 31st</p>
<p><strong>Indexing Type:</strong> Seasonally adjusted change since January 2020. Data is indexed in 2019 and 2020 as the change relative to the January index period. We then seasonally adjust by dividing year-over-year, which represents the difference between the change since January observed in 2020 compared to the change since January observed since 2019. We account for differences in the dates of federal holidays between 2019 and 2020 by shifting the 2019 reference data to align the holidays before performing the year-over-year division.</p>
<p><strong>Geographies:</strong> National, State, County, Metro</p>
<p><strong>Breakdowns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>By Industry</em>. Industries are constructed by grouping merchant codes that are used by Affinity Solutions to identify the category of merchant and merchant activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apparel and General Merchandise</li>
<li>Entertainment and Recreation</li>
<li>Grocery</li>
<li>Health Care</li>
<li>Resturants and Hotels</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>By Consumer Zip Code Income</em>. Transactions are linked to zip codes where the consumer lives and zip codes are classified into income categories based on measurements of median household income and population provided by the American Community Survey (2014 - 2018).</p>
<ul>
<li>High Income (median household income greater than $78,000 per year)</li>
<li>Middle Income (median household income between $46,000 per year and $78,000 per year)</li>
<li>Low Income (median household income less than $46,000 per year)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The raw data contains discontinuous breaks caused by entry or exit of credit card providers from the sample. In order to reliably identify and correct these breaks, we require at least 3 weeks of data. The most recent 3 weeks of data are therefore marked 'provisional' and are subject to non-negligible changes as new data is posted. For breaks found prior to the last 3 weeks, we correct for it using a method outlined in the <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf">paper</a>. Otherwise we substitute the national mean for more recent breaks while we gather enough data to implement the corrections outlined in the <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf">paper</a>. Additionally, at the county-level when are there more than one structural breaks the data is too noisy to correct for these breaks and counties with multiple breaks are dropped from the sample. Lastly, Affinity Solutions suppresses any cut of the data with fewer than five transactions. For more details refer to the accompanying <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf">paper</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>Small businesses are defined as those with annual revenue below the Small Business Administration's <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards">thresholds</a>. Thresholds vary by 6 digit NAICS code ranging from a maximum number of employees between 100 to 1500 to be considered a small business depending on the industry.</p>
<p>County-level and metro-level data and breakdowns by High/Middle/Low income ZIP codes have been temporarily removed since the August 21st 2020 update due to revisions in the structure of the raw data we receive. We hope to add them back to the OI Economic Tracker soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-businesses-open">Small Businesses Open</h2>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Number of small businesses open, as defined by having had at least one transaction in the previous 3 days.</p>

<p><strong>Geographies:</strong> National, State, County, Metro</p>
<p>We exclude counties with a total average revenue of less than $250,000 during the indexing period (January 4-31). Additionally we omit spending categories for a small number of geographies that are extreme positive outliers, and we cap a small number of extreme negative outliers at 0 revenue.</p>

<h2 id="employment">Employment</h2>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Number of active employees, aggregating information from multiple data providers. This series is based on firm-level payroll data from Paychex and Intuit, worker-level data on employment and earnings from Earnin, and firm-level timesheet data from Kronos.</p>
<p><strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.paychex.com/">Paychex</a>, <a href="https://www.intuit.com/">Intuit</a>, <a href="https://www.earnin.com/">Earnin</a>, <a href="https://www.kronos.com/">Kronos</a></p>
<p><strong>Update Frequency:</strong> Weekly</p>
<p><strong>Date Range:</strong> January 15th until the most recent date available. The most recent date available for the full series depends on the combination of Paychex, Intuit and Earnin data. We extend the national trend for the Low Income employment subgroup by using Kronos timecard data to forecast beyond the end of the Paychex, Intuit and Earnin data.</p>
<p><strong>Data Frequency:</strong> Daily, presented as a 7-day moving average</p>
<p><strong>Indexing Period:</strong> January 4th - January 31st</p>
<p><strong>Indexing Type:</strong> Change relative to the January 2020 index period, not seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p><strong>Geographies:</strong> National, State, County, Metro</p>
<p>To prevent the introduction of new Paychex clients from artificially creating noise in the employment series overtime, in the underlying raw data we suppress county x quartile x industry x firm size cells that both (i) experience a large anomalous change in employment and (ii) made up a large share of given wage quartile's total employment at any point in a county in the current year. For more details on the specifics of these thresholds see the appendix of the <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf">accompanying paper</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For low income workers, the change in employment is calculated using Paychex and Earnin data. For medium and high income workers, the change in employment is calculated using Paychex and Intuit data.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to provide closer to real time data, we forecast the most recent employment measures beyond those available in the combined Earnin, Intuit, and Paychex dataset alone. To do so, we leverage two sources of higher frequency data: Kronos timestamp data and the Paychex weekly pay cycle sample. Using this higher frequency data we forecast more recent changes in employment using a distributed lag model, constructed by regressing a given week’s employment measure on the corresponding week’s Kronos measure, as well as its current and 3 previous lagged weeks’ Paychex weekly pay cycle measure.

</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Google does not release data for geographies where their internal quality and privacy thresholds are not met. Therefore some geographic areas are omitted from the series for certain finer breakdowns while the release of others can be delayed while under review. When data is missing for 1 or 2 consecutive days we linearly interpolate the missing values and construct the 7 day moving average including these interpolated values. If data is missing for 3 or more consecutive days, the corresponding 7 day moving average is also recorded as missing whenever it overlaps with the missing data.</p>
<p>Time Away From Home is calculated by multiplying the mean time spent inside home from the American Time Use Survey by the percent change in time spent at residential locations reported by Google.
