## Overview

Each data source and level of aggregation has a separate CSV, named using the following convention: *Data source* – *Geographic Level of Aggregation* – *Temporal Level of Aggregation*

Additionally, we have three files, **GeoIDs – State** and **GeoIDs – County** and **GeoIDs – City**, that provide information on geographic crosswalks and aggregation. These can be merged to any file sharing the same geographic level of aggregation using the geographic identifier. Additionally, **GeoIDs – County** indicates the commuting zone (CZ) and state that each county belongs to. The City-level data (listed under "Metro" on the tracker site) associates the largest cities in the United States with a representative county one-to-one (except in the case of New York City which includes the 5 boroughs).

Finally, we have gathered a collection of key state-level policy dates relevant for changes in other series trends and values. These are contained in the **Policy Milestones – State** file.

A description of the columns in each file follows.

Note that for every variable listed here, there is a corresponding variable with the prefix `break_` (for example, `break_engagement`). During the period in which schools are on summer or winter break, we records the outcomes in these `break_` variables instead of the usual variables. These numbers are not displayed on the [Economic Tracker](https://tracktherecovery.org) because they do not reliably measure differences in student learning across geography and income groups when many schools are on break.
